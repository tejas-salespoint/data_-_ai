        The market for the movement of people and goods is one of the largest and most dynamic ecosystems globally which represents $6T in global revenues today and is projected to grow to $11T by 2030 (~6% CAGR). This shift is disrupting the ecosystem, creating the opportunity for new market entrants to become future market leaders and driving traditional players to partner with technology providers who can help them reinvent their business models and deliver next generation experiences across automotive, mobility, and transportation. While we represent these industry trends separately, the alignment of automotive, mobility, and transportation was purposeful as the lines between each continue to converge.
