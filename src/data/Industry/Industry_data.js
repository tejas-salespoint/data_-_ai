                Automated quality control improves inspection measurement
                reliability. Accurate measurements on complex parts and high
                throughput production lines is assured with automated inspections.
                These systems can capture more data for large quantities of parts
                faster. <br />
                <br />
                Artificial Intelligence of Things (AlT) is the combination of
                artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of
                Things (loT) infrastructure to achieve more efficient loT
                operations, improve human-machine interactions and enhance data
                management and analytics. Automated quality inspection typically
                leverages Al image analysis (vision) and data from loT sensors to
                identify product quality issues in real-time on the production
                line, triggering an alert for further inspection and/or action if
                problems are detected. <br />
